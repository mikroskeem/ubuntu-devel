# ubuntu-devel

See available branches

## Why?

[GCC](https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc/) is cool image, but does not allow
installing anything depending on gcc(?) (such as build-essential and so on).
Also there weren't any updated images for similar purpose either so this is
my try to provide some.

Feel free to base your images on mine or use in CI to compile your native
applications (like [I do](https://github.com/mikroskeem/musl_root/tree/master/ci))
